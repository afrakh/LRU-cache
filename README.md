# LRU Cache with GUI, Theme Support, and Database Integration

This project is an advanced implementation of an **LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache** using **Python**, which features:
- A user-friendly **Tkinter GUI**
- **SQLite database** integration for persistent storage
- **Hit/Miss statistics tracking**
- Support for **light/dark themes**
- And an efficient **O(1) time complexity** for `get()` and `put()` operations

> Developed as an Open-Ended Lab project for the **Data Structures and Algorithms (CS-218)** course at **NED University**.
